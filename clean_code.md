A very important aspect of clean code is naming because names are an oportunity to communicate with other developers.
+ Choose your names carefully
+ Communicate your intention with names
+ Dont disinformate with your names: it must say what it means and mean what it says
+ Write pronounceable names
+ Don't use encondings, variable types etc in names
