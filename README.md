# A Wiki "muy tocha" for developers!

This wiki is intended for personal use in terms of developing high quality code. The only purpose is to gather usefull links, good practices, conventions, IDEs, commands, testing tools, linting tools, tutorials and **all those things every developer should have in mind**. Although I created the wiki for my own benefit, it may come in handy for more people and friends, so I thought Github was a right place for sharing.

## Introduction

The benefits of being a good code developer that uses continuous integration and good practices are huge:
- Saving **a lot** of time
- Clean code
- Free from bugs code
- Ready to change code
- Easy to read code

## Index

In this wiki I will cover the following topics with the goal of being a better developer:

* [Coding conventions](https://github.com/Catacrockers/WikiTocha/blob/master/coding_conventions.md)
* [Writing clean code](clean-code)
* The [developer toolbelt](developer-toolbelt) (IDE, StackOverflow, Github, power phrases, HackerRank)
