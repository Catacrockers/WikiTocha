# A Wiki "muy tocha" for developers!

This wiki is intended for personal use in terms of developing high quality code. The only purpose is to gather useful links, good practices, conventions, IDEs, commands, testing tools, linting tools, tutorials and **all those things every developer should have in mind**. Although I created the wiki for my own benefit, it may come in handy for more people and friends, so I thought GitHub was a right place for sharing.
