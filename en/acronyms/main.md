## Important concepts

* **Bootstrap**: usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input. (Booting) [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping)
* **Chipset**: It is a set of electronic components in an integrated circuit that manages the data flow between the processor, memory and peripherals. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset)
* **CRT0**: (also known as c0) is a set of execution startup routines linked into a C program that performs any initialization work required before calling the program's main function. It generally takes the form of an object file called crt0.o, often written in assembly language, which is automatically included by the linker into every executable file it builds.
* **Co-processor**: A coprocessor is a processing core that supplements the functionality of the primary processor, and is optimised for a single, specific task. By off-loading computations from the main processor to one or more co-processing units, the overall system performance can be accelerated.
* **Code coverage**: is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs.
* **Cold migration**: is the process to suspends OS and applications on virtual machines before transferring them to physical machines. User have the option of moving the associated disks from one datastore to another. The virtual machines are not required to be on shared storage and the virtual machine you want to migrate must be powered off prior to beginning the cold migration process. Types of migration available depend on the hypervisor selected.
* **Command-line interface**: is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).
* **Constraint programming**: is a programming paradigm wherein relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming)
* **Device driver**: is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver)
* **Embedded system**: An embedded system is a specialised computing system that is optimised to carry out a single, or very few, dedicated functions.
* **Embedded Processor**: An embedded processor is one which is physically embedded within the programmable fabric of an FPGA device. Embedded processors come in two varieties — hard and soft processors. Hard processors are those which are built from dedicated silicon outwith the general-purpose logic of the FPGA device, whereas a soft processor is built using the general-purpose logic of the FPGA. A soft processor must be synthesised to fit into the FPGA fabric. In the case of all embedded processors, both hard and soft, the local memory, bus interconnects,
memory controllers and internal peripherals must be realised in the FPGA general-purpose logic.
* **Ethernet**: is a family of computer networking technologies commonly used to connect computers. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet)
* **Exception**: It is an automatically generated interrupt that occurs in response to some exceptional condition violation.
* **Full Virtualization**: is virtualization in which the guest operating system is unaware that it is in a virtualized environment, and therefore hardware is virtualized by the host operating system so that the guest can issue commands to what it thinks is actual hardware, but really are just simulated hardware devices created by the host.
* **Hardware interrupt**: It is a kind of trap raised due to an external hardware event (external to the CPU) when a device require attention.
* **Hot migration**: is the transfer of the OS and applications from virtual machines to physical machines without stopping OS operations or applications. Types of migration available depend on the hypervisor selected.
* **Hypervisor**: is a piece of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. It has three essential characteristics: equivalence, efficiency, safety. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)
* **Intel HEX**: is a file format that conveys binary information in ASCII text form. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX).
* **Intel VT technology-x**: Intel Virtualization Technology for x86 that provides hardware assist to the virtualization software, reducing its size, cost, and complexity. Special attention is also given to reduce the virtualization overheads occurring in cache, I/O, and memory. Is an example of platform virtualization at hardware level.
* **Java virtual machine**:  is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. An instance of a JVM is an implementation running in a process that executes a computer program compiled into Java bytecode. Is an example of platform virtualization at operating system level.
* **Jitter**: is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably periodic signal, often in relation to a reference clock signal. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter)
* **Logical Partition**: is a subset of a computer's hardware resources, virtualized as a separate computer. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_partition)
* **Memory Controller**: Memory controllers manage the reading and writing of data to and from main memory in an embedded system. Memory controllers reside in on-chip soft cores, providing an interface between the system memory and all other parts of the system.
* **Microcontroller**: A microcontroller contains an entire computing system on a single chip. Unlike a microprocessor, a microcontroller comprises of a CPU with a fixed amount of RAM/ROM and peripherals all within a single Integrated Circuit (IC).
* **Microkernels**: This kind of kernel is broken down into separate processes, known as servers. Some of the servers run in kernel space and some run in user-space. All servers are kept separate and run in different address spaces. Servers invoke "services" from each other by sending messages via IPC (Interprocess Communication). This separation has the advantage that if one server fails, other servers can still work efficiently. Drivers are not inside microkernels.
* **Microprocessor**: A microprocessor is a single chip integrated circuit which contains the complete central processing unit, and nothing else. In order to make a microprocessor functional, external memory in the form of RAM and ROM, and other peripherals must be added. The CPU in a PC is a good example of a microprocessor.
* **Monolithic kernel**: is a single large process running entirely in a single address space. It is a single static binary file. All kernel services exist and execute in the kernel address space. The kernel can invoke functions directly. Drivers are inside monolithic kernels.
* **Operative System** : is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)
* **Paravirtualization**: Paravirtualization is a type of virtualization in which the host layer is not aware of the abstraction layer, but the guest layers is. A guest operative system (virtualized) is aware that it is a guest (virtualizer) and accordingly has drivers and methods, instead of use hardware directly. Guest just use an API with the host operating system. Host operative system must provide indirect memory access in user mode. This also includes memory and thread management as well, which usually require unavailable privileged instructions in the processor. Traditional virtualization by emulation, host and guest layer are not aware of the abstraction layer between them.
* **Partial virtualization**: including address space virtualization, the virtual machine simulates multiple instances of much of an underlying hardware environment, particularly address spaces. Usually, this means that entire operating systems cannot run in the virtual machine—​which would be the sign of full virtualization— ​but that many applications can run. A key form of partial virtualization is address space virtualization, in which each virtual machine consists of an independent address space. This capability requires address relocation hardware, and has been present in most practical examples of partial virtualization.
* **Peripherals**: These are the components around the central processing unit. Peripherals can be implemented as individual integrated circuits, be contained on-chip with the processor, or may reside in an area of programmable logic such as an FPGA.
* **Peripheral Bus**: The second bus creates two separate sections of the system, allowing two arbiters to control and manage communications across the two buses. This allows devices on the peripheral bus to communicate with each other, even when a high-priority processor-memory transaction is taking place on the system bus.
* **Preemption**: It is the act of temporarily interrupting a task being carried out by a computer system. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_(computing))
* **Processor**: This is the ‘brains' of the system. It is programmed to perform the tasks specific to the application of the embedded system.
* **Process**: It is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.
* **Runlevel**: In Linux kernel, the idea behind SysV init runlevels revolves around the idea that different systems can be used in different ways. It provide some services for each level. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runlevel)
* **Software architecture**: is the discipline of creating such structures, and the documentation of these structures.
* **Software trap**: It is raised by a processor instruction and it is commonly used to implement the system call mecha-nism in the operating systems.
* **System bus**: In an embedded system with multiple buses, the system bus connects the processor, memory controller and other high-speed devices together. As such, it is the bus with the greatest bandwidth in the system.
* **Time Triggered Ethernet**: Deterministic ethernet protocol. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTEthernet)
* **Trap**: It is the mechanism provided by the processor to implement the asynchronous transfer of control. When a trap occurs, the processor switches to supervisor mode and unconditionally jumps into a predefined handler.
* **Trunking**: It is a method for a system to provide network access to many clients by sharing a set of lines or frequencies instead of providing them individually. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking)
* **Udev**: udev is a device manager for the Linux kernel responsible for providing an abstract interface of the hardware to the rest of the software. Being a monolithic kernel, the Linux kernel does exactly that, and device drivers are part of the Linux kernel, which make up more than 50% of its source code.
* **Validation**: The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers. Contrast with verification.
* **Verification**: The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process. Contrast with validation.
* **Virtual machine**: is an efficient, isolated duplicate of the real machine. It represents the
abstract layer between host layer and guest layer.
* **V-Model**: It is a typical software development process in systems with certification DO-178C. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model)
* **Xen**: is a hypervisor using a microkernel design, providing services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware concurrently. [Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen)
