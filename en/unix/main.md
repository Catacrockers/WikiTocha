# Unix and derivatives operative systems

This is a guide of useful Unix shell commands for making your life better.

GNU/Linux is based on Unix. This operative system has a kernel that allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and communications in response to system calls. Also, provide a shell or command line interpreter (CLI) to manage the operative system using commands. Unix-like variants are cool.

The sections contained here are the following:

* [Unix concepts](https://github.com/Catacrockers/WikiTocha/blob/master/en/unix/concepts.md), basic info to know about terminal, bash and UNIX.
* [Unix commands](https://github.com/Catacrockers/WikiTocha/blob/master/en/unix/commands.md), basic and advanced commands and shortcuts to work from terminal.
* [Pipes](/unix/pipes.md), how manage and redirect standard streams to processes and files.
* [Cryptography](https://github.com/Catacrockers/WikiTocha/blob/master/en/unix/cryptography.md), keys like SSH, GPG, how to create them and how manage keys and passwords.

# Manuals

If you need to learn about any command, you have several ways to do this.

* [Man](https://linux.die.net/man/): Usage ```man $(command)```: man is an interface to the on-line reference manuals. Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.
* [TLDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read), install with ```sudo npm install -g tldr```, require nodeJS. Usage: ```tldr $(command)```: Alternative manual, with several command line clients, in example Python to check command description and useful examples. Require install the package for your distro. This command have REALLY good examples.
* [Cheat](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat), install with ```sudo pip install cheat```, require python pip.
