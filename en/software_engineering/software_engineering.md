# Software Engineering

This sections lists a set of techniques (including theories, methods, processes, tools and languages) for developing and operating production software-intensive systems meeting defined standards of quality.

## Software Engineering
A good definition of software enginnering:

> The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software"â€”IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology

The need of software engineering appears to solve the issues of low quality software proyects. Software engineering defines software development lifecycle of a project, which can be sumarized in the following steps:

1. Communication of the project to the team
2. Requirement Gathering: Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
3. System Analysis 
4. Software Design: Architecture Description (AD)
5. Coding 
6. Testing (Idealy testing will be done at the same time as coding, TDD) 
7. Integration 
8. Deployment 
9. Operations and maintenance 


## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

A software requirements specification is a description of a software system to be developed. The software requirements specification lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and it may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide.

[IEEE 380](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse870/IEEEXplore-SRS-template.pdf) provides a standard for SRS. It is important that the first part of the SRS refelcts the business language and goals, and the business managers must agree with the requirements. A common way of writing requirements is using **use cases**, because use cases also define a way to test the system later.

### Use cases

In software engineering, a use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between an actor and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system. Use case analysis is a valuable requirement analysis technique that is often used in SRS and test plans. 

Some interesting books on use cases are
+ Writing Effective Use Cases - Alistair Cockburn
+ USE-CASE 2.0 - Dr. Ivar JacobsonIan SpenceKurt Bittner
