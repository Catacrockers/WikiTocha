# Software Engineering

This sections lists a set of techniques (including theories, methods, processes, tools and languages) for developing and operating production software-intensive systems meeting defined standards of quality.

## Software Engineering
A good definition of software enginnering:

> The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software"â€”IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology

The need of software engineering appears to solve the issues of low quality software proyects. Software engineering defines software development lifecycle of a project, which can be sumarized in the following steps:

1. Communication of the project to the team
2. Requirement Gathering: Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
3. System Analysis 
4. Software Design: Architecture Description (AD)
5. Coding 
6. Testing (Idealy testing will be done at the same time as coding, TDD) 
7. Integration 
8. Deployment 
9. Operations and maintenance 


## System Requirements Specification

## Use cases

## Architecture Description: Stakeholders and concerns

## Architecture Description: diagrams, plantuml

## Architecture Decision Records

## Verification & Validation: testing, test plan

## Monitoring: structured logging, centralized logs
