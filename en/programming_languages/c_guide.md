# C guide

# Why programming in C/CPP

C is a high-level programming language that was first developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. Unix was one of the first operating systems to be written in C. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and GNU/Linux are also written in C. Lots of other high-level languages like Perl, PHP, Python, R, Matlab, Mathematica, etc, are written in C.

## Virtues of C

* It's fast (it's a compiled language and so is close to the machine hardware)
* It's portable (you can compile you program to run on just about any hardware platform out there)
* The language is small (unlike C++ for example)
* It's mature (a long history and lots of resources and experience available)
* There are many tools for making programming easier (e.g. IDEs like Xcode)
* You have direct access to memory
* You have access to low-level system features if needed

## Challenges of using C

* The language is small (but there are many APIs)
* It's easy to get into trouble, e.g. with direct memory access & pointers
* The code — compile — test (crash) — debug cycle
* You must manage memory yourself
* Sometimes code is more verbose than in high-level scripting languages like Python, R, etc

# How programming in C/CPP

A lot of books focus on Object-oriented programming (C++), but it is important to master C creating fiable algorithms.

* [What is a compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)
* [Source to source compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler)

## Concepts

* [Basic definitions](http://www.cprogramming.com/compilingandlinking.html)
* [Header vs source file](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3482948/any-fundamental-difference-between-source-and-header-files-in-c)

## Books

Some books I love it:

* [Modern C++ Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_C%2B%2B_Design), de Andrei Alexandrescu.
* [Operating Systems Design and Implementation (3rd Edition)](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Minix_3), more info [here](http://www.minix3.org/doc/)

* [Secure Coding in C and C++, 2nd Edition](http://www.cert.org/secure-coding/publications/books/secure-coding-c-c-second-edition.cfm?)

## Websites

Some interesting websites to improve programming skills:

* [The GNU C Reference Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html)
* [C programming](http://www.cprogramming.com/)
* [C reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/c), focus on C.
* [Learn C](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming#learn-c-tutorial)

* [C++ Programming/Code/Design Patterns](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/Code/Design_Patterns)
* [Cplusplus reference](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/), vgoni prefer this website for C++
* [Learning C++ from another languages](https://isocpp.org/faq), a very complete guide to learn.

## Online social networks

Best way to learn is read or work in free repositories, answer questions, etc...

* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* [Free software foundation](https://www.fsf.org/)

## Advanced C++
