# Coding Conventions

Every work environment or communitiy should define a **coding convention** or order to make code readable and homogeneous. There are standards for every language but any team can adapt their own rules as long as it is documented and clear. 

> Nobody should be able to recognise the developer by reading the code.

The benefits of coding conventions are:
- Code integration
- Team member integration
- Maintenance
- Uniform problem solving
- Time saving

Here are some coding conventions for languages I use the most:
- **Python:** [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) , [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- **C++:** [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
