# Programming tools

Here are some fundamental programming tools for control version, code analysis, testing and developing that every code developer should know and use.

# Version Control Collaboration tools

* Gitlab
* Github
* Bitbucket/Jira/Confluence

# Continuous integration

## Tools

* Git: TODO
* [Mercurial](https://github.com/Catacrockers/WikiTocha/blob/master/en/programming_tools/mercurial.md) <img src="https://www.iconattitude.com/icons/open_icon_library/apps/png/256/mercurial.png" height=25/>: a condensed cheatsheet

# Virtualization

## Docker

* **TODO**

# Templates

This section cover tools to generate things from templates

## Cookiecutter

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a command line application that generates projects from project templates.

It is very useful for teams, for generating the same folder structure, default files, license for the projects.

* A sample for using cookiecutter can be found in [vgonisanz/cookiecutter-usage-template](https://github.com/vgonisanz/cookiecutter-usage-template)
* A cpp template can be found in [Catacrockers/cookiecutter-cpp-project](https://github.com/Catacrockers/cookiecutter-cpp-project)

# C/CPP source code analysis

* [cppcheck](/programming_tools/cppcheck.md): It is a tool to analyze source code statically.
* [gcov](/programming_tools/gcov.md): It is a tool to analyze source code dinamically.
