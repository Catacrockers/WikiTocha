# Programming tools

Here are some fundamental programming tools for control version, code analysis, testing and developing that every code developer should know and use.

# Version Control Collaboration tools

* Gitlab
* Github
* Bitbucket/Jira/Confluence

# Continuous integration

## Tools

* [Codacy](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/207278449-Getting-started-with-Codacy)
* [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/), Software analytics, sonar self-hosted.
* [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/), GNU/Linux & Mac test code
* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/),
* [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/), Python code analysis

# Virtualization

## Docker

* **TODO**

# Templates

This section cover tools to generate things from templates

## Cookiecutter

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a command line application that generates projects from project templates.

It is very useful for teams, for generating the same folder structure, default files, license for the projects.

* A sample for using cookiecutter can be found in [vgonisanz/cookiecutter-usage-template](https://github.com/vgonisanz/cookiecutter-usage-template)
* A cpp template can be found in [Catacrockers/cookiecutter-cpp-project](https://github.com/Catacrockers/cookiecutter-cpp-project)

# C/CPP source code analysis

* [cppcheck](/programming_tools/cppcheck.md): It is a tool to analyze source code statically.
* [gcov](/programming_tools/gcov.md): It is a tool to analyze source code dinamically.
