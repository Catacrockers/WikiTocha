# Scrum

Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development. Incremental changes.

# The Manifesto for Agile Software Development

1. Individuals and interactions: Self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming.
1. Working software: Working software is more useful and welcome than just presenting documents to clients in meetings.
1. Customer collaboration: Requirements cannot be fully collected at the beginning of the software development cycle, therefore continuous customer or stakeholder involvement is very important.
1. Responding to change: Agile methods are focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.

# Rols

Each member at least has a rol. But only one product owner and scrum master exist.

## Product owner

No matter which development method is followed, every team should include a customer representative (product owner in Scrum). He must:

* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items.
* Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions.
* Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs.
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next.
* Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

## Development Team

The Development Team is responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments (PSIs) of product at the end of each Sprint (the Sprint goal). It must be:

* Self-organizing, no one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality.
* Cross-functional with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment.
* No titles for Development Team members other than Developer.

## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum framework is followed.

### Service to the Product Owner

* Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management.
* Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items.
* Understanding product planning in an empirical environment.
* Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value.
* Understanding and practicing agility.
* Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

### Service to the Development Team

* Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality.
* Helping the Development Team to create high-value products.
* Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress.
* Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.
* Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

### Service to the Organization

* Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption.
* Planning Scrum implementations within the organization.
* Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development.
* Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team.
* Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

# Events

## Sprint

* ~1-4 weeks cycles. No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal.
* Quality goals do not decrease.
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.
* Each day, development team has a daily meeting.

### Planning

* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

### Review and retrospective

* Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner.
* The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done".
* The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved.
* The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment.
* The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely completion dates based on progress to date (if needed).
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning.
* Review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed what is the most valuable thing to do next.
* Review of the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product.

## Daily Scrum Meeting

A fifteen-minute daily meeting at same place for each teammember to answer three questions,
even if some Development Team members are missing:

1. What have I done since the last Scrum meeting?
1. What will I do before the next Scrum meeting?
1. What prevents me from performing my work as efficiently as possible?
