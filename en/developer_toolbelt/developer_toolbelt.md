# The Developer Toolbelt

Every developer must have its working tools, consulting websites, good practices manual and power phrases for never losing the north when developing. 

If you want to be a good developer you just need attitude and know that the following tools exist and can help you to improve your skills:

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): For every quenstion you have you must search first in StackOverflow. 90% of your programming questions are already solved. The rest are just your specific case. 

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com): Train daily with HackerRank. You have many challenges for all languages. Do some gym every day and keep away from getting rusty.

- [Github](https://github.com/): Before you start a new project you should do some research in Github. Most well-known libraries are hosted here and you can learn a lot from this community. Look for projects with a high number of stars and contributors and have a look to the code, issues, pull requests, documentation, etc.

- IDE: Choose the right IDE for your project. There are some IDEs that fit for many languages, but maybe in some cases there is a **"best"** IDE. You must search for and IDE that provides debugging, linting, intellisense, console, profiling, etc. The most important is that you feel confortable with the IDE and it saves you time.

- [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/): Full and rich information system to search software alternatives. It is possible to filter by license type and system. Also it is possible to vote and contribute with alternatives making the system information more social because it is built with the users effort.

- Power Phrases: Every developer should have a list of **power phrases** that remind what is important when developing. Power phrases are sacred principles that reveal a truth in programming.
    
    * **Good developers**
        * > Hours of planning can save you weeks of programming
        * > Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?
        * > Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live
        * > Functions should only do one thing, do it right, and do only that.
        * > Be kind with your team mates, keep your code clean.
        * > Clean code reads like well-written prose.
    * **Bad developers**
        * > It works on my machine
        * > I don't make tests because I don't have time
