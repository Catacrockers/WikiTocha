This section cover tools to generate things from templates

## Cookiecutter

[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) is a command line application that generates projects from project templates.

It is very useful for teams, for generating the same folder structure, default files, license for the projects.

* A sample for using cookiecutter can be found in [vgonisanz/cookiecutter-usage-template](https://github.com/vgonisanz/cookiecutter-usage-template)
* A cpp template can be found in [Catacrockers/cookiecutter-cpp-project](https://github.com/Catacrockers/cookiecutter-cpp-project)

# C/CPP source code analysis

* [cppcheck](/programming_tools/cppcheck.md): It is a tool to analyze source code statically.
* [gcov](/programming_tools/gcov.md): It is a tool to analyze source code dinamically.
