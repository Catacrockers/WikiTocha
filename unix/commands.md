# Redirecting pipes

A pipeline is a sequence of processes chained together by their standard streams, so that the output of each process (stdout) feeds directly as input (stdin) to the next one.

## Redirect to files

Then, it is possible to redirect the output of a process (stdout) to a new file (overriding its content):

```
$ command > outputfile.txt  
```

It is possible to append stdout to a file at the bottom:

```
$ command >> outputfile.txt
```

If you want redirect the error messages of a process (stderr) as well use this:

```
$ command &> outputfile.txt   
```

To append it just:

```
$ command &>> outputfile.txt   
```

If you want to have both stderr and output displayed on the console and in a file use 'tee' command and pipe the output to it:

```
$ command | tee outputfile.txt
```

A slight modification will catch stderr as well:

```
$ command 2>&1 | tee outputfile.txt
```

or slightly shorter and less complicated:

```
$ command |& tee outputfile.txt
```

To summarize:

```
          || visible in terminal ||   visible in file   || existing
  Syntax  ||  StdOut  |  StdErr  ||  StdOut  |  StdErr  ||   file   
==========++==========+==========++==========+==========++===========
    >     ||    no    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    || overwrite
    >>    ||    no    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    ||  append
----------||----------|----------||----------|----------||----------
   2>     ||   yes    |    no    ||    no    |   yes    || overwrite
   2>>    ||   yes    |    no    ||    no    |   yes    ||  append
----------||----------|----------||----------|----------||----------
   &>     ||    no    |    no    ||   yes    |   yes    || overwrite
   &>>    ||    no    |    no    ||   yes    |   yes    ||  append
----------||----------|----------||----------|----------||----------
 | tee    ||   yes    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    || overwrite
 | tee -a ||   yes    |   yes    ||   yes    |    no    ||  append
----------||----------|----------||----------|----------||----------
 n.e. (*) ||   yes    |   yes    ||    no    |   yes    || overwrite
 n.e. (*) ||   yes    |   yes    ||    no    |   yes    ||  append
----------||----------|----------||----------|----------||----------
|& tee    ||   yes    |   yes    ||   yes    |   yes    || overwrite
|& tee -a ||   yes    |   yes    ||   yes    |   yes    ||  append
----------||----------|----------||----------|----------||----------
```

* Please note that the n.e. in the syntax column means "not existing".
** There is a way, but it's too complicated to fit into the column. You can find a helpful link in the List section about it.

# Connections

To connect to a server though terminal you need to:

```
ssh $(user_name)@$(server_address)
```

# Key management

## SSH

To create a SSH key:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This command will place a ssh key (public and private) at ```~/.ssh``` folder. Never share private key, and use public key to set up connections to remote terminals. In this folder you will have the following files:

* authorized_keys: Holds a list of authorized public keys for servers. When the client connects to a server, the server authenticates the client by checking its signed public key stored within this file.
* id_rsa: Contains your PRIVATE key. Never share!
* id_rsa.pub: Contains your PUBLIC key. You can share it.
* known_hosts: Contains DSA host keys of SSH servers accessed by the user. This file is very important for ensuring that the SSH client is connecting the correct SSH server.

## Passwords

Never share your passwords. Never reuse your passwords if is possible. Using a Password manager is a good strategy to improve your security.

### pass

pass is a utility to manage your passwords across several devices. It is the standard unix password manager. It require to create a gpg key. It can be managed though several computers using git directly though the command.

To generate a new key:

```
pass generate $(key_name) $(number_of_character)
```

* Note: key name support ```/```, so you can store in a folder system several keys. In example: ```$(key_group)/$(my_key)``` is a valid ```$(key_name)```
* Note II: Use ```[--no-symbols,-n]``` to avoid symbols and ```[-c]``` option to avoid printing and store it in the clipboard.

To get a key stored:

```
pass $(key_name)
```

* Note: Use ```[-c]``` option to avoid printing and store it in the clipboard.

To save key created:

```
pass git push
```

To get new keys:

```
pass git pull
```

# Concepts

# Files and directories

UNIX use binary files and folder. Folders group 0 or more folders and files and are organized following Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| / | Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy |
| /bin | Essential command binaries that need to be available in single user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp |
| /boot | Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd |
| /dev | Essential device files, e.g., /dev/null |
| /etc | Host-specific system-wide configuration files |
| /etc/opt | Configuration files for add-on packages that are stored in /opt/ |
| /etc/sgml | Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes SGML |
| /etc/X11 | Configuration files for the X Window System, version 11 |
| /etc/xml | Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that processes XML |
| /home | Users' home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc |
| /lib | Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/ |
| /lib<qual> | Alternate format essential libraries. Such directories are optional, but if they exist, they have some requirements |
| /media | Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3) |
| /mnt | Temporarily mounted filesystems |
| /opt | Optional application software packages |
| /proc | Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount |
| /root | Home directory for the root user |
| /run | Run-time variable data: Information about the running system since last boot, e.g., currently logged-in users and running daemons |
| /sbin | Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route |
| /srv | Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems |
| /sys | Contains information about the devices connected to the computer |
| /tmp | Temporary files (see also /var/tmp). Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted |
| /usr | Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications |
| /usr/bin | Non-essential command binaries (not needed in single user mode); for all users |
| /usr/include | Standard include files |
| /usr/lib | Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin/ and /usr/sbin/ |
| /usr/lib<qual> | Alternate format libraries (optional) |
| /usr/local | Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to this host. Typically has further subdirectories, e.g., bin/, lib/, share/ |
| /usr/sbin | Non-essential system binaries, e.g., daemons for various network-services |
| /usr/share | Architecture-independent (shared) data |
| /usr/src | Source code, e.g., the kernel source code with its header files |
| /usr/X11R6 | X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 (up to FHS-2.3, optional) |
| /var | Variable filesâfiles whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the systemâsuch as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files |
| /var/cache | Application cache data. Such data are locally generated as a result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data. The cached files can be deleted without loss of data |
| /var/lib | State information. Persistent data modified by programs as they run, e.g., databases, packaging system metadata, etc |
| /var/lock | Lock files. Files keeping track of resources currently in use |
| /var/log | Log files. Various logs |
| /var/mail | Mailbox files. In some distributions, these files may be located in the deprecated /var/spool/mail |
| /var/opt | Variable data from add-on packages that are stored in /opt/ |
| /var/run | Run-time variable data. This directory contains system information data describing the system since it was booted |

In FHS 3.0, /var/run is replaced by /run; a system should either continue to provide a /var/run directory, or provide a symbolic link from /var/run to /run, for backwards compatibility.

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| /var/spool | Spool for tasks waiting to be processed, e.g., print queues and outgoing mail queue |
| /var/spool/mail | Deprecated location for users' mailboxes |
| /var/tmp | Temporary files to be preserved between reboots |

Using ```ls -l``` in a path, you can get a output like this:

```
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root     0 Jan  1  1970 home
```

What is the meaning for `drwxr-xr-x`:
* First word:
  * First character: d = Is a directory. If is a file will appear -.
  * The followint 3 character sequences are permissions for user owner, group of user owners and rest of users: r = read, x = execution, w = write. No permission appear -.
* Second word is `2`: Number of files/folders inside including it.
* Third word is the Owner, in this case `root`.
* Forth word is the User, in this case `root`.
* Fifth word is Size of the file, is a folder so it is zero. In this case is `0`
* Next third words are the date, in this case: `Jan  1  1970`.
* And the last one is the file/folder name: `home`
